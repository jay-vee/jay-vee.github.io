# Vaccination & COVID variants

The discussion of COVID, masks, lockdowns, vaccination, etc. has become so wrapped up in politics and disinformation campaigns that it's tough to talk about in person.  I've been keeping this page to document basic facts and logical reasoning around these issues.  If I've given you this link, it's because I care about you and would like you to give me a hearing without getting in to an argument.

## You Will Get To Meet COVID 

The COVID virus is essentially endemic at this point: there are too many copies in too many places to expect that it will be eradicated any time soon.

So, it will continue to infect people who will then make millions of copies of the virus and breathe it into their surroundings.  They will spread it before they know they have it, so they won't be able to control where they spread it.   

Now that most Americans have had at least one vaccination shot, the virus will actually spread more easily than it has previously.  That's because the various COVID-related lifestyle restrictions are being lifted and people are doing things that they had stopped doing during the various lockdowns: eating in restaurants and bars, going to the mall, going to indoor gyms, flying, etc.  And, because the health risk from COVID is dramatically lower for vaccinated individuals, they are doing all of these things without masks.

For folks who haven't been vaccinated, this is a much more dangerous situation than life under lockdown was: many of the barriers to COVID transmission have been lowered, but unvaccinated individuals don't have the added protection that vaccinated individuals have (more on this here).

These are simple facts that have nothing to do with politics, personal preference or worldview, etc. 

Ultimately, this situation means that **you are going to come into contact with COVID eventually**.  When you do, your body will either succeed in fighting it, or you will die.

So, your body will have to learn how to fight it.  

There are two ways this can happen: 
  1. You can have the vaccine teach your body how to fight it without actually becoming infected. 
  1. You can have COVID teach your body how to fight it by becoming infected.  

Either way, you're going to experience symptoms and side-effects while your immune system activates.  

Intuitively, it seems like it would be better to not have to manage these symptoms and side-effects while COVID is running rampant in your system (potentially causing life-threatining damage). 

Luckily, we don't have to rely on intuition: hundreds of millions of people have been administered one or two shots of a COVID vaccine at this point.  The resulting data is clear: serious illness or death is **thousands of times more likely from COVID infection than from being vaccinated**.  One can argue the finer points of how injuries/deaths from COVID are counted vs. incidents resulting from vaccination are counted, but the relative risk remains massively tilted in favor of vaccination.  

So, you can do this the relatively safe, controlled way.  Or you can do it the way that has been demonstrated to be thousands of times more risky.  Remember: the risk we're talking about here is death or serious lasting illness.

If it's that simple, why aren't you vaccinated yet?  You may think you don't need to take vaccination seriously for of one of these reasons: 
  1. I'm pretty sure I had COVID in 2020, so I'm all set
  1. I'm healthy, have a great immune system, and didn't catch COVID yet so that's proof it's not dangerous
  1. I'm young (under 80, or under 50, or under 30, or under 18, or under 12) and so COVID isn't a problem for me
  1. Everyone else is vaccinated, so the actual threat from COVID in the US is over

Unfortunately, none of those reasons looks very in light of... 
  
## Mutations & 'Variants of Concern' 

Every time the virus duplicates itself, there's a chance of a duplication error- a mutation.  As millions of people are infected, trillions of copies of the virus are made.  The sheer volume of copies means that it's likely that some of these random errors make the virus better at spreading.  For example, a mutation may make allow the virus to evade the immune system better, or bind more easily to receptors in the body, creating more copies of itself per infection.

When a mutation is so successful that it starts to crowd out existing versions of the virus, we see it emerge in the genetic analysis of COVID test results.  These mutated versions of the virus get labeled as 'variants of concern'.  
 
The problem with emerging variants is that their success against previous variants is based in the fact that they are more effective at spreading than the previous variants.  This is worth repeating: **the new variants are more contagious than the COVID we faced in 2020 and earlier this year**.

## Delta ('Indian') Variant

The Delta variant, which was first noticed in India, started showing up in US test results in late-March.  It only accounted for 1.3% of US cases in early May, but grew to 9.5% of US cases earlier this month.  Now it's close to 25% of US cases. 

This quick growth curve is because this variant is 50% more contagious than the 'Alpha' variant that attacked the UK earlier this year, and ~93% more contagious than the original COVID virus that we dealt with in 2020.

In fact, there are a number of documented cases of 'glancing' transmission of the Delta variant.  In Sydney, Australia, where a new outbreak of the Delta variant has the city going back into lockdown-like restrictions (as of late-June 2021), public health officials have documented the spread of the virus through a shopping center where people caught the virus simply by walking by the originally infected person.  **This variant is a highly contagious airborne virus** that won't be contained by simply by routinely disinfecting surfaces, washing hands, and trying to keep people 6ft apart.  
 
It is more contagious, because it's more effective at copying itself in the body per unit of time and it it's more effective at remaining active in the body.  This means people that contract the Delta variant tend to experience a much higher viral load than people who contracted the original virus.  This makes this virus more dangerous for the people who catch it: more people are going to the hospital with this variant and more people are dying from it.
