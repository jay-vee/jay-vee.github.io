# Vaccination & COVID variants

The COVID virus is essentially endemic at this point.  Meaning, there are too many copies in too many places to expect that it will be eradicated any time soon.

This means that it will continue to infect people, who will then continue to make millions of copies of the virus and breathe it into their surroundings.  Because of the delay between a person being contagious and developing symptoms, people spread it before they know they have it.  

Now that most Americans have had at least one vaccination shot, the virus will actually spread faster than in the past year and a half.  That's because people are doing things that they had stopped doing during the various lockdowns: eating in restaurants and bars, going to the mall, going to indoor gyms, flying, etc.  And, because the risk to vaccinated individuals is not as high, they are doing all of these things without masks.

For folks who haven't been vaccinated, this is a much more dangerous situation than life under lockdown: many of the barriers to COVID transmission have been lowered, but unvaccinated individuals don't have the same protection as vaccinated individuals.

These are simple facts that have nothing to do with politics, personal preference or worldview, etc. 

Ultimately, this situation means that **you are going to come into contact with COVID eventually**.  When you do, your body will either succeed in fighting it, or you will die.

So, your body will have to learn how to fight it.  

There are two ways this can happen: 
  1. You can have the vaccine teach your body how to fight it without actually becoming infected. 
  1. You can have COVID teach your body how to fight it by becoming infected.  

Either way, you're going to experience symptoms and side-effects while your immune system activates.  

Intuitively, it would seem like it would be better to not have to manage these symptoms and side-effects while COVID is running rampant in your system, potentially causing life-threatining damage. Luckily, we don't have to rely on intuition: we have vaccinated hundreds of millions of people with one or two shots of a COVID vaccine at this point.  The resulting data is clear: serious illness or death is **thousands of times more likely from COVID infection than from being vaccinated**. 

So, you can do this the relatively safe, controlled way.  Or you can do it the way that has been demonstrated to be thousands of times more risky.  Remember: the risk we're talking about here is death or serious lasting illness.

But that's not all ...
  
## Mutation / Variation

Every time the virus duplicates itself, there's a chance of a duplication error- a mutation.  As millions of people are infected, trillions of copies are made.  The sheer volume of copies means that it's likely that some of these random errors make the virus better at spreading.  For example, a mutation may make allow the virus to evade the immune system better, or bind more easily to receptors in the body, creating more copies of itself per infection.

When a mutation is so successful that it starts to crowd out existing versions of the virus, we see it emerge in the genetic analysis of COVID test results.  These mutated versions of the virus get labeled as 'variants of concern'.  
 
## Delta ('Indian') Variant

The problem with emerging variants is that their success against previous variants is based in the fact that they are more effective at spreading than the previous variants.  This is worth repeating: **the new variants are more contagious than the COVID we faced in 2020 and earlier this year**.

The Delta variant, which was first noticed in India, started showing up in US test results in late-March.  It only accounted for 1.3% of US cases in early May, but grew to 9.5% of US cases earlier this month.  Now it's close to 25% of US cases. 

This quick growth curve is because this variant is 50% more contagious than the 'Alpha' variant that attacked the UK earlier this year, and ~93% more contagious than the original COVID virus that we dealt with in 2020.

In fact, there are a number of documented cases of 'glancing' transmission of the Delta variant.  In Sydney, Australia, where a new outbreak of the Delta variant has the city going back into lockdown, they've documented the spread of the virus through a shopping center where people caught the virus simply by walking by the originally infected person.  This is a highly contagious airborne virus that won't be contained by washing surfaces or keeping people 6ft apart.  
 
It is more contagious, because it's more effective at copying itself in the body per unit of time and it it's more effective at remaining active in the body.  This means people that contract the Delta variant tend to experience a much higher viral load than people who contracted the original virus.  This makes this virus more dangerous for the people who catch it: more people are going to the hospital with this variant and more people are dying from it.
